# Connecto
This project is a web application, designed to connect teachers with parents.
I utilized C#, .NET, Bootstrap, MySQL, HTML, SendGrid API.
There are three user roles in this app, Admin, Parent and Teacher.
Parents can sign in and review their child's grades, progress (not yet created as functions)
and being able to communicate with teachers via chat, which is still public.I used SendGrid for the message funcionality.
Teachers can sign in for a list of students with parents and they can chat with parents too.
They can make announcements and reply to a certain message
